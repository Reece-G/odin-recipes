    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large onion, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot, peeled, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>1 celery stalk, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
        <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>4 oz. pancetta (Italian bacon), finely chopped</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1 14.5-oz. can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 cups low-sodium chicken broth, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pulse onion, carrot, and celery in a food processor until finely chopped.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add beef, pork, pancetta, and vegetables; cook, breaking up
            meat with a spoon, until moisture is almost completely evaporated and meat is well browned, 25–30 minutes;
            season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add wine to pot and bring to a boil, scraping up browned bits from bottom of pot, about 2 minutes. Add milk;
            bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until moisture is almost completely evaporated, 8–10 minutes. Add
            tomatoes and 2 cups broth; bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, adding water by ½-cupfuls if sauce
            looks dry, until flavors meld and sauce thickens, 2½–3 hours.</li>
        <li>Let sauce cool, then cover and chill at least 12 hours or up to 2 days. (Letting the sauce sit will give it
            a deeper, richer flavor.)</li>
        <li><strong>DO AHEAD:</strong> Sauce can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill.</li>
        <li>Whisk salt and 3 cups flour in a large bowl, make a well in the center, and crack eggs into well. Mix eggs
            with a fork, then slowly mix in flour until a shaggy dough forms. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured
            surface and knead, dusting lightly with flour if sticky, until smooth, about 5 minutes (it will be fairly
            stiff). Wrap in plastic; let sit until dough holds an indentation when pressed, 1–2 hours.</li>
        <li>Set pasta maker to thickest setting; dust lightly with flour. Divide dough into 4 pieces. Working with 1
            piece at a time and keeping remaining dough wrapped in plastic as you work, flatten dough into a narrow
            rectangle (no wider than mouth of machine); pass through rollers. Fold dough as needed to fit and run
            through again. Repeat without folding, adjusting machine to thinner settings after every pass and dusting
            with flour if sticky, until pasta sheet is 1/16” thick (setting 8 on most machines). Place pasta sheets on a
            lightly floured surface and cut crosswise into 16 8”-long noodles.</li>
        <li><strong>DO AHEAD:</strong> Dough can be made 1 day ahead; chill. Bring to room temperature before rolling
            out, about 1 hour.
            Noodles can be made 1 day ahead. Stack on a baking sheet with a piece of parchment paper between each layer.
            Cover with plastic wrap and chill.</li>
        <li>Heat butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat until foaming. Add flour and cook, whisking constantly, 1
            minute. Whisk in warm milk, ½-cupful at a time. Bring sauce to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, whisking
            often, until the consistency of cream, 8–10 minutes; add nutmeg and season with salt. Remove from heat,
            transfer to a medium bowl, and press plastic wrap directly onto surface; let cool slightly.</li>
        <li><strong>DO AHEAD:</strong> Béchamel can be made 1 day ahead. Keep covered and chill.</li>
        <li>Reheat the sauces. Combine Bolognese sauce and remaining 1 cup broth in a large saucepan over medium heat,
            and heat until sauce is warmed through.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, if you made the béchamel ahead of time, heat in a medium saucepan over low heat just until warmed
            through (you don’t want to let it boil).</li>
        <li>Working in batches, cook fresh lasagna noodles in a large pot of boiling salted water until just softened,
            about 10 seconds. Remove carefully with tongs and transfer to a large bowl of ice water; let cool. Drain
            noodles and stack on a baking sheet, with paper towels between each layer, making sure noodles don’t touch
            (they’ll stick together).</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°. Coat a 13x9” baking dish with butter.</li>
        <li>Spread ¼ cup béchamel in the prepared baking dish. Top with a layer of noodles, spread over a scant ¾ cup
            Bolognese sauce, then ½ cup béchamel, and top with ¼ cup Parmesan. Repeat process 7 more times, starting
            with noodles and ending with Parmesan, for a total of 8 layers. Place baking dish on a rimmed baking sheet
            and bake lasagna until bubbling and beginning to brown on top, 50–60 minutes. Let lasagna sit 45 minutes
            before serving.</li>
        <li><strong>    DO AHEAD:</strong> Lasagna can be assembled 12 hours ahead. Cover and chill. Let sit at room temperature 2 hours
            before baking. Cook, covered with foil until the last 20 minutes, then finish cooking uncovered.</li>
        <li>Homemade pasta is great: It's rich and can be rolled very thin. But of course it's not your only option:
            Fresh store-bought: Available in the refrigerated section of specialty stores and Italian grocers. Usually a
            bit thicker than what our recipe calls for but still a good choice. Buy 1½ pounds. Sizes vary by shop; if
            needed, trim the noodles during assembly to fill the pan without much overlap. Dried: If you spot imported
            dried egg noodles, they're worth the splurge, but standard supermarket durum wheat will work just fine
            (avoid no-boil, though). Supermarket noodles are thicker, so make fewer layers. Cook 24 noodles (1–1½ boxes)
            per package instructions; divide sauces evenly among 6 layers. Trim noodles as needed.</li>
