    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The cookie, a famous and world renowned treat the world over!</p>
    <p>Made from simple ingredients the cookie is delicious, especially served warm with ice cream.</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>120g softened butter</li>
        <li>75g light brown sugar</li>
        <li>75g golden caster sugar</li>
        <li>1 medium egg</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>180g plain flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
        <li>150g dark chocolate</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step-by-step instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients</li>
        <li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line two baking sheets with parchment.</li>
        <li>Cream the butter and sugars together until very light and fluffy, then beat in the egg and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Once combined, stir in the flour, bicarb, chocolate and ¼ tsp salt.</li>
        <li>Scoop 10 large tbsps of the mixture onto the trays, leaving enough space between each to allow for
            spreading.</li> 
        <li>Bake for 10-12 mins or until firm at the edges but still soft in the middle – they will harden a
            little as they cool.</li>
        <li>Leave to cool on the tray for a few mins before eating warm, or transfer to a wire rack
            to cool completely. Will keep for three days in an airtight container.</li>
    </ol>
